- This React app was used to gather all the knowledge I managed to learn after having completed a React Course. 
- The knowledge about fetching data from an API was not included on this app, as I will be creating a Pokedex linked to what seems to be called PokeAPI.
- As a side note, I used GIT while I was developing this app for the very first time after having completed the GIT course.
