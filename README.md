- This app was used to gather all the knowledge I managed to learn after having completed the React Course. 
- The knowledge about fetching data from an API with React was not included, as I will be creating a Pokedex where I will be able to practice that specific knowledge. 
- As a side note, I used GIT while I was developing this app for the very first time after having completed the GIT course.
